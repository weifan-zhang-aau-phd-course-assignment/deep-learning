What you denominate "feature" rather is "feature map" or "channel".

I was expecting a bit better accuracy when using SGD. The result from using Adam makes sense to me.

About 1.3.1, yes, but also notice that you end up with less parameters, and typically there is a strong correlation between the number of model parameters and the model's energy consumption. Generally, you could outperform a traditional FFNN by exploiting local two-dimensional (i.e., spectro-temporal in our case) correlations that are present in the input signal.

All the rest looks very good. Awesome job and report! Very thorough!
